This toy application involves using the pika library to talk to a RabbitMQ broker, with the task of building a web application.

The web framework is CherryPy, and it utilized Spring Python (http://springpython.webfactional.com) to do various things like
implement security.

The assumption is you are using some sort of virtualenv setup like this:

% virtualenv sp --no-site-packages

From this, it is recommended to download and install Spring Python (see web site for where to get the bundle), along with
installing CherryPy and pika.

After that, to run it:

% python twitter_clone.py

Unfortunately, the polling thread blocks, so to kill it, you must background it then kill the job.
